This package provides a set of simple math utilities to work with angles. The
utilities cover simple things like normalizing an angle and conversion between
degrees and radians. But even if you're trying to calculate things like the
shortest angular distance between two joint space positions of your robot, but
the joint motion is constrained by joint limits, this package is what you
need.
