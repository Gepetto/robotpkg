The ros-geometry package contains several tools to deal with manipulation of
geometry entities like frames.

- tf
tf is a package that lets the user keep track of multiple coordinate frames
over time. tf maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree
structure buffered in time, and lets the user transform points, vectors, etc
between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time.

- {tf, kdl, eigen}_conversions
functions to convert between TF, KDL, Eigen and ROS datatypes
