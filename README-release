How to release a new version of a package
-----------------------------------------

autotools packages
------------------
In the package 
  - be sure that your working version is up to date.
  - in ChangeLog: add missing commit messages and notify new release 
  - in configure.ac: upgrade the version number 
  - in configure.ac or package.pc.in: upgrade dependency versions
  - cd build; make to check that package compiles
  - cd build; make dist
  - ftp softs.laas.fr (login jrl if MASTER_SITES=${MASTER_SITE_JRL} in pkgconfig Makefile)
    > put nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz

In openrobots/robotpkg/.../package
  - update Makefile with new version number
  - make mdi
  - make install
  - make print-PLIST > PLIST.tmp builds the list of files and directories to be destroyed when deinstalling.
  - edit PLIST.tmp and remove irrelevant lines.
  - mv PLIST.tmp PLIST
  - make clean to remove build directory.
  - commit the modifs.
    - prefix commit message by [category/package],
    - insert list of changes from ChangeLog in commit body message.

In the package
  - commit and push
  - add a tag.
    - git-tag -m "release x.y" x.y
  - increment version number as x.y.99
  - git commit 
  - git-push --tags

cmake packages
--------------

In the package 
  - be sure that your working version is up to date.
  - make a temporary branch: git branch release-x.y <commit-id>
  - git checkout release-x.y
  - in ChangeLog: add missing commit messages and notify new release 
  - in CMakeLists.txt: upgrade the version number 
  - in CMakeLists.txt: upgrade dependency versions
  - cd build; rm -rf *; cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp ..; make install to check that package compiles
  - git commit -a
  - git archive --format=tar --prefix=nameofthepackage-x.y/ HEAD | gzip > nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz
  - ftp softs.laas.fr (login jrl if MASTER_SITES=${MASTER_SITE_JRL} in pkgconfig Makefile)
    > put nameofthepackage-x.y.tar.gz
  
In openrobots/robotpkg/.../package
  - update Makefile with new version number
  - make mdi
  - make install
  - cp work/nameofthepackage-x.y/install_manifest.txt PLIST.tmp
  - edit PLIST.tmp and 
    - remove installation prefix in absolute paths: (e.g. /home/florent/openrobots/lib/pkgconfig/nameOfThePackage.pc -> lib/pkgconfig/nameOfThePackage.pc)
    - add directives to remove directories created by this package (e.g. @dirrm include/nameOfThePackage)
  - mv PLIST.tmp PLIST
  - make clean to remove build directory.
  - commit the modifs.
    - prefix commit message by [category/package],
    - insert list of changes from ChangeLog in commit body message.

In the package
  - git commit 
  - add a tag.
    - git-tag -m "release x.y" x.y
  - merge branch release-x.y into master
  - increment version number as x.y.99
  - git commit 
  - git-push --tags

Important
---------

It is recommended to do one commit by package upgraded. It is then easier to trace 
back the changes in each package.
