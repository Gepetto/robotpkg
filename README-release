How to release a new version of a package
-----------------------------------------

In the package 
  - be sure that your working version is up to date.
  - in ChangeLog: add missing commit messages and notify new release 
  - in configure.ac: upgrade the version number 
  - in package.pc.in: upgrade dependency versions
  - cd build; make to check that package compiles
  - cd build; make dist and copy package.tar.gz into softs.laas.fr:/www/htdocs/openrobots/distfiles 

In openrobots/robotpkg/.../package
  - update Makefile with new version number
  - make mdi
  - make install
  - make print-PLIST > PLIST.tmp builds the list of files and directories to be destroyed when deinstalling.
  - edit PLIST.tmp and remove irrelevant lines.
  - mv PLIST.tmp PLIST
  - make clean to remove build directory.
  - commit the modifs.
    - prefix commit message by [category/package],
    - insert list of changes from ChangeLog in commit body message.

In the package
  - commit and push
  - add a tag.
    - git-tag -m "release x.y" x.y
    - git-push --tags

Important
---------

It is recommended to do one commit by package upgraded. It is then easier to trace 
back the changes in each package.
