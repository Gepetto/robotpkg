This package contains a class for converting from a 2D laser scan as defined by
sensor_msgs/LaserScan into a point cloud as defined by sensor_msgs/PointCloud
or sensor_msgs/PointCloud2. In particular, it contains functionality to account
for the skew resulting from moving robots or tilting laser scanners.
