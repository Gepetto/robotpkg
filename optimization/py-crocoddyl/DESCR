Contact RObot COntrol by Differential DYnamic programming Library.

Crocoddyl is an optimal control library for robot control under contact
sequence. Its solver is based on an efficient Differential Dynamic Programming
(DDP) algorithm. Crocoddyl computes optimal trajectories along to optimal
feedback gains.
