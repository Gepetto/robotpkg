qpOASES is an open-source C++ implementation of the recently proposed
online active set strategy, which was inspired by important observations
from the field of parametric quadratic programming (QP). It has several
theoretical features that make it particularly suited for model predictive
control (MPC) applications. Further numerical modifications have made
qpOASES a reliable QP solver, even when tackling semi-definite, ill-posed or
degenerated QP problems. Moreover, several interfaces to third-party software
like  Matlab or  Simulink are provided that make qpOASES easy-to-use even for
users without knowledge of C/C++.
