ProxSuite is a collection of open-source, numerically robust, precise and
efficient numerical solvers (e.g., LPs, QPs, etc.) rooted on revisited
primal-dual proximal algorithms. While the first targeted application is
Robotics, ProxSuite can be used in other contextes without any limits. Through
ProxSuite, we aim at offering to the community scalable optimizers which can
deal with dense, sparse or matrix-free problems.
