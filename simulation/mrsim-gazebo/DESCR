mrsim-gazebo is a gazebo plugin for multi-rotor simulation.

It emulates the tk3-mikrokopter software running on Mikrokopter hardware via a
pty implementing the tk3-mikrokopter communication protocol and all the
tk3-mikrokopter features so that the hardware can be fully emulated.

The rotor dynamics are simulated using a realistic motor model and a simple
thrust/drag propeller model. The same hardware velocity controller as
implemented in the tk3-mikrokopter software controls the propellers
velocities. Then, at the user's choice, either the geometry of a model can be
used to compute the total wrench applied to the rigid body, or an explicit
allocation matrix can be specified.
