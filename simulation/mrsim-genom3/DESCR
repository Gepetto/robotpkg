Multi-rotor simulator.

Provides a pty emulating the tk3-mikrokopter communication protocol and
implements all the tk3-mikrokopter features. In addition, a 'gps' port provides
a simulation of a gps/motion capture device and a 'state' port provides the
full state without noise, to be used as a 'ground truth' state.
