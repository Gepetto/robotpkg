OpenHRP (Open Architecture Humanoid Robotics Platform) is a software
platform for humanoid robotics, and consists of a dynamics simulator,
view simulator, motion controllers and motion planners of humanoid
robots. OpenHRP has been developed by AIST, the University of Tokyo and
MSTC. OpenHRP is integrated by CORBA, and each module, e.g. the dynamics
simulator, of OpenHRP is implemented as a CORBA server. The users can
develop their own software on OpenHRP as well as replace its building
blocks by their own ones.

This package is the JRL version and contains HRP-2 control module and
simulator.
