The Generator of Modules GenoM is a tool to design real-time software
architectures. It encapsulates software functions inside independent
components. GenoM is more specifically dedicated to complex on-board systems,
such as autonomous mobile robots or satellites, that require:

. The integration of heterogeneous functions with different real-time
  constraints and algorithm complexities (control of sensors and actuators,
  data processings, task planification, etc.).

. An homogeneous integration of these functions in a control architecture which
  requires coherent and predictable behaviors (starting, ending, error
  handling), and standard interfaces (configuration, control flow, data
  flow).

. The management of parallelization, physical distribution and portability of
  the functions.

. Simple procedures to add, modify or (re)use the functions by non-specialists


GenoM generates the source code of components by using:

. A generic template, common for all components. This guarantees that all
  components share the same consistent behaviour. The template itself is not
  part of GenoM, so that different template kind can be developped easily.

. A formal description of the components interface. This description is based
  on a simple language using OMG IDL for data types definitions and a custom
  syntax for the description of a more detailed component model.
