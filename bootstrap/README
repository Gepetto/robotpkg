To try to get robotpkg working on your system, please try the following:

# ./bootstrap
    [ --prefix <prefix> ]
    [ --workdir <workdir> ]
    [ --help ]

The default for the prefix argument is as follows:

        --prefix        /opt/openrobots
        --workdir       work

A working directory will be created if it doesn't exist and has to be
writable by the user executing ./bootstrap.

If the prefix does not exist already, it will also be created. Since this will
usually fail for regular users (because of permissions), it is advised to
create it as root first and change its ownership to the user executing
./bootstrap. robotpkg does not require root privileges at all.

Make sure that you have a working C compiler and make(1) binary in
your path (GNUmake >= 3.81 required).

See robotpkg/README.txt or http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg/README.html
for more information about bootstrapping and using robotpkg.

Please remember to add $prefix/bin AND $prefix/sbin to your PATH environment
variable and $prefix/man to your MANPATH environment variable, if necessary.
(See above for --prefix and its default value.)

The bootstrap script will create an example robotpkg.conf file located
in your prefix as "etc/robotpkg.conf". It contains the settings you provided to
the bootstrap.
