This unary stack contains the dynamic_reconfigure package which provides a
means to change node parameters at any time without having to restart the
node.

At present, the focus of dynamic_reconfigure is on providing a standard way to
expose a subset of a node's parameters to external reconfiguration. Client
programs, e.g., GUIs, can query the node for the set of reconfigurable
parameters, including their names, types, and ranges, and present a customized
interface to the user. This is especially useful for hardware drivers, but has
broader applicability.
