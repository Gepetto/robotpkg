Robot Operating System (ROS) is a meta-operating system for your robot.
It provides several services for a robot control system, including but
not limited to:
* language-independent and network-transparent communication
* including hardware abstraction
* low-level device control
* implementation of commonly-used functionality
* message-passing between processes

This package provides ROS communications-related packages, including core
client libraries (roscpp, rospy, roslisp) and graph introspection tools
(rostopic, rosnode, rosservice, rosparam).
