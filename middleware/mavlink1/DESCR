MAVLink -- Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library.

This is a library for lightweight communication between Micro Air Vehicles
(swarm) and/or ground control stations. It serializes C-structs for serial
channels and can be used with any type of radio modem.

Messages definitions are created in XML, and then converted into C header
files.
