eprosima Fast DDS (formerly Fast RTPS) is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data
Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). eProsima
Fast DDS implements the RTPS (Real Time Publish Subscribe) protocol, which
provides publisher-subscriber communications over unreliable transports such as
UDP, as defined and maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG)
consortium. RTPS is also the wire interoperability protocol defined for the
Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard. eProsima Fast DDS expose an API to
access directly the RTPS protocol, giving the user full access to the protocol
internals.

Some of the main features of this library are:

* Configurable best-effort and reliable publish-subscribe communication
  policies for real-time applications.
* Plug and play connectivity so that any new applications are automatically
  discovered by any other members of the network.
* Modularity and scalability to allow continuous growth with complex and simple
  devices in the network.
* Configurable network behavior and interchangeable transport layer: Choose the
  best protocol and system input/output channel combination for each
  deployment.
* Two API Layers: a high-level Publisher-Subscriber one focused on usability
  (DDS) and a lower-level Writer-Reader one that provides finer access to the
  inner workings of the RTPS protocol.
