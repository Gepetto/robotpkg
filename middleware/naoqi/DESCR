NAOqi, the embedded NAO software, includes a fast, secure and reliable,
cross-platform, distributed robotics framework that provides a solid foundation
on which developers can leverage and improve NAO's functionality.

NAOqi allows algorithms to share their APIs with others and helps prepare
modules to run on NAO or remote PCs.
