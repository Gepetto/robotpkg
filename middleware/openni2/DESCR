The OpenNI 2.0 API provides access to PrimeSense compatible depth sensors. It
allows an application to initialize a sensor and receive depth, RGB, and IR
video streams from the device.  It provides a single unified interface to
sensors and .ONI recordings created with depth sensors.  OpenNI also provides a
uniform interface that third party middleware developers can use to interact
with depth sensors. Applications are then able to make use of both the third
party middleware, as well as underlying basic depth and video data provided
directly by OpenNI.
