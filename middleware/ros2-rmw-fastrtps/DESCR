rmw_fastrtps actually provides not one but two different ROS 2 middleware
implementations, both of them using Fast DDS as middleware layer:
rmw_fastrtps_cpp and rmw_fastrtps_dynamic_cpp (note that directory
rmw_fastrtps_shared_cpp just contains the code that the two implementations
share, and does not constitute a layer on its own).

The main difference between the two is that rmw_fastrtps_dynamic_cpp uses
introspection typesupport at run time to decide on the
serialization/deserialization mechanism. On the other hand, rmw_fastrtps_cpp
uses its own typesupport, which generates the mapping for each message type at
build time.

Mind that the default ROS 2 RMW implementation is rmw_fastrtps_cpp. You can
however set it to rmw_fastrtps_dynamic_cpp using the environment variable
RMW_IMPLEMENTATION.
