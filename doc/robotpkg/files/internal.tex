The following variables and inclusion are useful for packages managed by {\tt autotools}. They should be defined in the installation Makefile of the package.

\paragraph{${\tt GNU\_CONFIGURE}$} should be set to {\tt yes} to invoke configure for configuration. 

\subsection*{Using cmake}

The following variables and inclusion are useful for packages managed by {\tt cmake}. They should be defined in the installation Makefile of the package.

\paragraph{${\tt USE\_CMAKE}$} should be set to {\tt yes} to invoke cmake for configuration. Moreover, the following inclusion should added after the definition of the above variable in the Makefile (assuming the Makefile is two directories below {\tt robotpkg} root directory):\\
{\tt include ../../mk/sysdep/cmake.mk}
