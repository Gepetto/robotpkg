Basically, there are two ways of using robotpkg.  The  first is to only install
the package tools  and to use binary packages  that someone  else has prepared.
The second way is  to install the programs from   source. Then you are able  to
build your  own packages, and  you can still use   binary packages from someone
else.


\section{Where to get robotpkg and how to keep it up-to-date} % ------------
\label{section:getting}

Before you download and extract the files, you need to decide where you want to
extract  them.  robotpkg is  usually installed  in  {\tt /opt/openrobots},  but
creating this directory will probably   require administration privileges.   If
you don't have such privileges, you are free to  install the sources and binary
packages wherever you want in your filesystem, provided  that the pathname does
not contain white-space or other  characters that are interpreted specially  by
the shell and some other programs.  A safe bet is to  use only letters, digits,
underscores  and dashes. The rest of  this  document will  assume  that you are
using {\tt  /opt/openrobots}.  You should adapt  this path to whatever location
you choosed.


\subsection{Getting robotpkg for the first time} % -------------------------

robotpkg  will {\em never} require administration  privileges by itself.  So we
recommend that you set up the {\tt  /opt/openrobots} directory with read, write
and execute permissions for your regular user  name and then  only work as this
user afterwards. If something ever goes really  wrong, you might thank yourself
later that you did so\ldots This  can be done with  the following commands in a
shell:

\begin{verbatim}
% sudo mkdir -p /opt/openrobots
% sudo chown `id -u` /opt/openrobots
\end{verbatim}

At  the    moment,  robotpkg   is      only   distributed    {\em  via}     the
\href{http://git-scm.com/}{\tt git}  software content  management  system. {\tt
git} will probably be available on your system but if you don't have it readily
installed   or if  you  are   unsure  about  it,   contact your  local   system
administrator.

There are two download methods: the anonymous one and the authenticated
one. The two methods are described here.


\subsubsection{Anonymous download}

Anonymous  download is perfect  if  you don't intend  to  work on  the robotpkg
infrastructure itself, nor commit any changes or packages additions back to the
robotpkg main repository.  This is the recommended way  to go: it will fit most
users' usage while still leaving the possibility to send feedback via patches.

As your regular user, simply run in a shell:

\begin{verbatim}
% cd /opt/openrobots
% git clone http://softs.laas.fr/git/robots/robotpkg.git
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Authenticated download}

Authenticated download requires a valid login  on the main robotpkg repository,
and  will give you  full commit access to this   repository. Assuming your user
name is ``{\tt user}'', run the following:

\begin{verbatim}
% cd /opt/openrobots
% git clone ssh://user@softs.laas.fr/git/robots/robotpkg
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Keeping robotpkg up-to-date} % ---------------------------------

robotpkg is  a living  thing: updates  to the packages  are made  perdiodicaly,
problems are fixed,  enhancements are developed\ldots  In order to get the most
recent packages descriptions, you should keep your robotpkg copy up-to-date by
regularly running {\tt git pull}:

\begin{verbatim}
% cd /opt/openrobots/robotpkg
% git pull
\end{verbatim}

When you update robotpkg, the git program will only  touch those files that are
registered in the git repository. That means that any packages that you created
on your own will stay unmodified. If you change files that  are managed by git,
later updates will try to merge your changes with  those that have been done by
others. See the git-pull manual for details.

If you want  to be informed  of package additions  and other  updates, a public
mailing    list  is   available    for   your    reading   pleasure.  Go     to
\url{https://sympa.laas.fr/sympa/info/robotpkg}    for   more  information  and
subscription.
