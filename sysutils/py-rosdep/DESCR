ROS packages sometimes require external libraries and tools that must be
provided by the operating system. These required libraries and tools are
commonly referred to as system dependencies. In some cases these system
dependencies are not installed by default. ROS provides a simple tool, rosdep,
that is used to download and install system dependencies.
