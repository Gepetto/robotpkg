This project provides two main things, the ability for packages to register
types of resources they install and the ability to make queries about those
resources at runtime. A resource can represent any kind of asset or
functionality provided by a package. The queries might be anything from "Which
packages are installed?" over "Which packages provide plugins of a certain
type?" to "What messages and services does a specific package provide?". This
project does not aim to catalog and explicitly reference all individual
resources, but rather to provide meta information about what resources are
provided by what packages and then providing absolute paths to the prefix
containing the package.
