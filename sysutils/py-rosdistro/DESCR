The rosdistro tool allows you to get access to the full dependency tree and the
vcs information of all packages and repositories. To increase performance, the
rosdistro tool will automatically look for a cache file on your local disk. If
no cache file is found locally, it will try to download the latest cache file
from the server. The cache files are only used to improve performance, and are
not needed to get correct results. rosdistro will automatically go to github to
find any dependencies that are not part of the cache file. Note that operation
without a cache file can be very slow, depending on your own internet
connection and the response times of github. The rosdistro tool will always
write the latest dependency information to a local cache file, to speed up
performance for the next query.
