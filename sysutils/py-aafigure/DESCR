This package provides a python module ``aafigure``, that can be used from other
programs, and a command line tool ``aafigure``. ASCII art figures can be parsed
and output as SVG, PNG, JPEG, PDF and more.

Example, test.txt:

            +-----+   ^
            |     |   |
        --->+     +---o--->
            |     |   |
            +-----+   V
