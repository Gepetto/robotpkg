tk3-flash is a command-line utility used to update the program stored
in permanent memory of microcontrollers. Currently, it supports only
programming the AVR microcontrollers with the Mikrokopter bootloader.

tk3-flash supports flashing the EEPROM or the flash memory. It also
allows to set parameters specific to the flashed program, without the
need for changing the program itself.
