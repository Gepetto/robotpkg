Unified Interface for Dynamic (Runtime) Typesupport and Serialization

This library provides a unified interface for creating and reflecting dynamic
types and dynamic data based off those types at runtime, as well as the
utilities that support those objects.

It is meant to be used with serialization support libraries that fulfill the
interface. Properly implemented, a user should be able to, given a serialized
buffer, the serialization library used to serialize it, and the buffer's
message/type description, obtain a way to introspect/reflect its contents.
