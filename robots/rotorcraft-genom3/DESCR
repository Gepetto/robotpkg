Low level hardware controller for tk3 quadrotors

Low level hardware controller for quadrotors talking the telekyb3 protocol.

This component reads a desired array of rotor velocities sent by attitude and
position controllers and pass them to the underlying hardware.

It communicates with the tk3-paparazzi or tk3-mikrokopter firmware running on
the hardware controller.
