The driver_common stack contains classes and tools that are useful throughout
the driver stacks. It currently contains: 
- driver_base: A base class for sensors
to provide a consistent state machine (retries, error handling, etc.) and
interface 
- timestamp_tools: Classes to help timestamp hardware events.

This stack has been deprecated.
