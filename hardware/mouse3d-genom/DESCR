The mouse3d-genom GenoM module exports data of the 3D Space Navigator mouse in
a poster.

There are two main requests:
- Init: initialize the mouse. It takes a device path (empty for
  auto-detection).
- Export: exports mouse data in the poster.

Other requests are:
- Stop: stops exporting data.
- Bindings: maps raw axis numbers into x,y,z Rx,Ry,Rz b0,b1
- Gains: apply a gain on the raw axis values.
- Threshold: set mouse position to 0 below this threshold (after gain).
