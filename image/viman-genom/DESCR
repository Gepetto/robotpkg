viman is a GenoM module that does pattern-based marker detection (barcode
style) and pose estimation.

The detection is based on the ARToolKitPlus framework (version 2.1.1: the
latest and definitive one). ARToolKitPlus detects the marker corners and
IDs. The corner detection is refined and a 3D pose (position and orientation)
is estimated thanks to OpenCV functions.

Viman read images via the viam GenoM module (image/viam-genom). It can do
either mono or stereo detection and pose estimation. For stereo-based
detection, the marker pose is estimated by a triangulation if the marker is
present in both images.

Viman can localize several objects at the frame rate speed. Objects can be
composed of several markers. Each object must be defined in an "object".cfg
file. To load objects into the viman module, objects must be declared in a
global configuration file. Those files must be stored in <prefix>/data/viman.
