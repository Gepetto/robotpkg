Robot Operating System (ROS) is a meta-operating system for your robot.
It provides several services for a robot control system, including but
not limited to:
* language-independent and network-transparent communication
* including hardware abstraction
* low-level device control
* implementation of commonly-used functionality
* message-passing between processes

This meta-package includes the packages from the 'robot' variant.
The robot variant is defined to be core, stable, ROS libraries for any robot
hardware. It is the "general robotics" libraries of ROS. It may not contain any
GUI dependencies.
