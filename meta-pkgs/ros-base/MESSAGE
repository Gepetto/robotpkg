To use ros, the following environment variables must be configured to contain
those values:

  ROS_MASTER_URI    http://localhost:11311
  ROS_PACKAGE_PATH  ${PREFIX}
  PYTHONPATH        ${PREFIX}/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages
  PATH              ${PREFIX}/bin

As an alternative to the above configuration, commands must be executed by
using the `env.sh' wrapper. For instance, roscore can be started like so:
  ${PREFIX}/env.sh roscore

In Bourne shell scripts, the following file can be sourced instead:
  ${PREFIX}/setup.sh
