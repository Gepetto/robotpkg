Apache log4cxx is a logging framework for C++ patterned after Apache
log4j. Apache log4cxx uses Apache Portable Runtime for most platform-specific
code and should be usable on any platform supported by APR. log4cxx is designed
to be reliable, fast and extensible. Since logging is rarely the main focus of
an application, the log4cxx API strives to be simple to understand and to use.
