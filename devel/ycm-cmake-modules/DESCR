The package YCM contains a set of CMake files that support creation and
maintenance of repositories and software packages. YCM has been written with
the aim of solving some of the problems encountered while managing large
research projects but it can be used outside it initial context.

YCM is not a replacement to CMake or yet another build system. YCM is just a
thin layer over CMake. It does not add extra dependencies like other build
systems, it does not use Python, Ruby, or other scripting languages, it is
written using CMake language. It is a collection of CMake modules, most of them
candidate for being contributed upstream.
