TinyXML is a simple, small, minimal, C++ XML parser that can be easily
integrating into other programs. It reads XML and creates C++ objects
representing the XML document. The objects can be manipulated, changed, and
saved again as XML.

*Please Note* that TinyXML development has stopped and all development has
moved to TinyXML-2.
