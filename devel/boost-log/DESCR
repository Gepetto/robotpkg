This library aims to make logging significantly easier for the application
developer. It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box tools, along with public
interfaces for extending the library. The main goals of the library are:

 * Simplicity. A small example code snippet should be enough to get the feel of
   the library and be ready to use its basic features.
 * Extensibility. A user should be able to extend functionality of the library
   for collecting and storing information into logs.
 * Performance. The library should have as little performance impact on the
   user's application as possible.
