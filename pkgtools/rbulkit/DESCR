rbulkit is a set of helper scripts for managing robotpkg bulk builds.
It features:

 - rbulk_cron, an example shell script that can be installed in a crontab. The
   script assumes that a working robotpkg source tree is available and setup
   and invokes a bulk target from there. Errors are e-mailed back.

 - rbulk_report will create (or update) an sqlite3 database from the results of
   a previous bulk build. The database is populated with the log files lefts by
   the robotpkg bulk target. rbulk_report can also generate a detailed (HTML)
   report from the bulk data available in the database.
