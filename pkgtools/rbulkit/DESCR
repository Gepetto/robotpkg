rbulkit is a set of helper scripts and programs for managing robotpkg bulk
builds. It features:

 - rbulk-build, a shell script performing all the necessary tasks to run a
   build and produce an HTML report.

 - rbulk-report creates (or update) an sqlite3 database from the results of
   a previous bulk build. The database is populated with the log files lefts by
   the robotpkg bulk target. rbulk_report can also generate a detailed (HTML)
   report from the bulk data available in the database.

 - rbulk-dispatchd schedules N parallel jobs amongst M with priority handling
   and job preemption.

 - rbulk-dispatch sends job requests to rbulk-dispatchd

 - rbulk-locked provides an advisory lock on a file from a shell script. It is
   designed to work on NFS filesystem.

 - rbulk-watchd is an inetd(8)-like daemon that executes jobs when it receives
   a remote notification.

 - rbulk-notify sends remote notifications to rbulk-watchd.
