The following command line options are available:
.Bl -tag -width pancake
.It Fl a
Create a debian package for all available packages in the source repository.
.It Fl r
Path to the source repository of binary packages. This should point to a
directory containing
.Pa .tgz
files and a
.Pa pkg_summary.gz
file.

.Sh NOTES
Dependencies and conflicts in the generated debian packages are strict,
i.e. they match exactly the versions of the available packages inside the
robotpkg source repository. This is done on purpose to handle so called
robotpkg "options" in package names and work around the impossibility to depend
on virtual packages with versions in the debian package format.
