In order to sign packages, you have to create a signing key pair and
place it in ${GPG_HOMEDIR}.

This can be done by running the following interactive command:
  ${GPG_CMD} --homedir=${GPG_HOMEDIR} --gen-key

To export the public key into a file, use the following:
  ${GPG_CMD} --homedir=${GPG_HOMEDIR} --output public.key -a --export

To change the default directory, set GPG_HOMEDIR in robotpkg.conf
