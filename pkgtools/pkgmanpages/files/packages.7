This manual page describes the variables that users of the
.Nx
packages system can set to alter the configuration of the package system,
and individual packages.

This section documents variables that typically apply to an individual
package.
Non-Boolean variables without defaults are *mandatory*.
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width XXXXXXXX
.It DIST_SUBDIR

.Pa ${DISTDIR} .
If set, all
.Pa ${DISTFILES}
and
.Pa ${PATCHFILES}
will be put in this subdirectory of
.Pa ${DISTDIR}.
.It ALLFILES
All of
.Pa ${DISTFILES}
and
.Pa ${PATCHFILES} .
.It IGNOREFILES
If some of the
.Pa ${ALLFILES}
are not checksum-able, set this variable to their names.
.It PKGNAME
Name of the package file to create if the
.Pa ${DISTNAME}
isn't really relevant for the package.
The default is
.Pa ${DISTNAME} .
.It SVR4_PKGNAME
Name of the package file to create if the
.Pa ${PKGNAME}
isn't unique enough on a SVR4 system.
The default is
.Pa ${PKGNAME}
which may be shortened when you use gensolpkg.
Only add SVR4_PKGNAME if
.Pa ${PKGNAME}
does not produce an unique package name on a SVR4 system.
The length of SVR4_PKGNAME is limited to 5 characters.
.It PKGREVISION

.Nx
Packages Collection (pkgsrc).
If set, this will be attached to the PKGNAME variable separated by
a

is set, or
.Pa /etc/mtree/BSD.pkg.dist
otherwise.
.It USE_X11
Instructs the package system that the package will use headers and libraries
from
.Dv X11BASE
and so a check must be made that these are available.
If they are not, an IGNORE message will be displayed, and the package
will not be built.
.It PLIST_SRC
Which file(s) to use to build
.Pa ${PLIST} .
Default is
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PLIST .
.It PLIST_SUBST
Patterns that get automatically expanded during the PLIST creation.
Takes arguments of the form
.Li VARNAME =
.Dq value
and subsequently replaces every occurrence of
.Li ${VARNAME}
with
.Li value .
.It INSTALL_FILE
The name of a script which will be invoked when installing
binary packages.
If there is a file called
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/INSTALL ,
that file will be used.

binary packages.
If there is a file called
