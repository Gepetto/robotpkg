`tnftp' is a portable version of the NetBSD ftp client, hence the name.
It was formerly known as `lukemftp'.

tnftp is installed under the name robotpkg_ftp to avoid confusion with
the regular ftp of your platform. It is used internally by the robotpkg
system to fetch the packages distribution files. It is also used by the
robotpkg_* package management programs to fetch the binary packages.
