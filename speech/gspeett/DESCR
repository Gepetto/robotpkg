gSpeett is a simple Python client to the Google Speech-To-Text (unofficial) API.

gSpeett encodes voice from the system microphone using a derivative of the speex
encoder, send it to Google server, and returns the text on stdout. By default,
it tries to detect silences to know when to stop recording. You can also
explicitly specify a record duration. It supports all languages supported by
the Google service itself (English, French and German have been successfully
tested). It can also convert pre-recorded FLAC file. As a fancy bonus, it can
also interface with Google Translate to automatically attempt to translate the
output to another language.
