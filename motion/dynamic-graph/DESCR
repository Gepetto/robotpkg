This software provides an efficient way to modelize a C++ data-flow.

A dynamic graph data-flow is composed of:

 - entities (graph nodes)
 - signals (input/output of a graph action)

Output signals can then be plugged into input signals to data transmission.

An efficient caching mechanism avoid useless data recomputation and a simple
built-in language can be used to control the graph actions.
