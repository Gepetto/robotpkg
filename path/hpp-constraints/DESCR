This package aims at dealing with systems subject to smooth non-linear
equality constraints.

The main class hpp::constrained::ConfigProjector numerically projects an input
configuration onto the sub-manifold of the configuration space defined by a
set of non-linear constraints of type CjrlGikStateConstraint.

Two other classes derive from this latter:
  - hpp::constrained::ConfigExtendor extends a configuration toward another
    configuration by remaining on the constrained submanifold.
  - hpp::constrained::GoalConfigGenerator randomly samples the configuration
    space and projects each sample onto the submanifold defined by a goal task.
