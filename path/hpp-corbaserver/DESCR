hpp-corbaserver implements a Corba interface with hpp-core library. Corba
requests can be sent to trigger actions in a ProblemSolver instance. Three
main Corba interfaces are implemented:

    * Robot: to build a Device and to insert it in the ProblemSolver instance,
    * Obstacle: to build obstacles and insert them in the ProblemSolver
      instance,
    * Problem: to define a path planning problem and solve it.

Python clients are provided to control a path planning application.
