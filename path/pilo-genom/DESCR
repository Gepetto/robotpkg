The module Pilo allows to execute lines, circle, broken lines and Reeds and
Shepp trajectories. Its main functionnalities are the following: 

- Geometrical smoothing of broken lines or Reeds and Shepp path using clothoid
  or anti-clothoid in order to avoid curvature discontinuities.  
- Computation of speed profils (v and w) according to given maximum velocities
  and accelerations.
- Execution of the trajectory thanks to a periodical production of the reference
  (speed and position). The speed can be dynamically modified.
