This ROS package allows to publish the state of a robot to tf. Once the state
gets published, it is available to all components in the system that also use
tf. The package takes the joint angles of the robot, as well as a kinematic
description (URDF file), as input and publishes the 3D poses of the robot
links, using a kinematic tree model of the robot. The package can both be used
as a library and as a ROS node.
