A GenoM module that exports raw motion capture data, in the form of a list of
objects and associated markers position. It gathers the data exported by EVa
Real-Time (EVaRT) or Cortex proprietary software from Motion Analysis(tm) via
an instance of the "evart-stream" server (net/evart-stream) running on the
motion capture host.
