tcl-genomix package provides a TCL package that interacts with the genomix HTTP
server and can control GenoM3 components.

It can prompt interactively for arguments of services. Services can be invoked
synchronously or asynchronously and callbacks can be triggered whenever
services complete.

tcl-genomix is best used in combination with the interactive eltclsh shell.
