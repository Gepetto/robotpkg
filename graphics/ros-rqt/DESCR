rqt is a Qt-based framework for GUI development for ROS. It consists of three
parts:

    rqt provides a widget rqt_gui that enables multiple `rqt` widgets to be
    docked in a single window.

    rqt_common_plugins - ROS backend tools suite that can be used on/off of
    robot runtime.

    rqt_robot_plugins - Tools for interacting with robots during their runtime.
