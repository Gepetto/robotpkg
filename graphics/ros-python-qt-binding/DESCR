This stack provides Python bindings for Qt.  There are two providers: pyside
and pyqt.  PySide is released under the LGPL.  PyQt is released under the GPL.

Also provided is adapter code to make the user's Python code independent of
which binding provider was actually used which makes it very easy to switch
between these.
