The VCG Lib could be defined as a portable C++ templated library for the
manipulation, processing of triangle and tetrahedral meshes, but that would be
unfair. VCG Lib is a library for managing 0,1,2 and 3-simplicial complexes,
which means Point Sets, Edge Mesh, Triangle Mesh and Tetrahedral Meshes. To be
completely honest, it is starting to support polygon meshes as well (stay
tuned).

It just happens that the research interests of the developers leaded to develop
mesh processing algorithms mostly for triangle meshes, but the kernel is there
waiting... However, to avoid annoying the reader with 0-simplices, maximal
simplices and so on, in this tutorial we will always refer to the case of
triangle meshes, extending the explanation to the other cases only where
appropriate.

The library, released under the GPL license, is the result of the collaborative
efforts of the Visual Computing Lab of the ISTI - an institute of the Italian
National Research Council (CNR).
