In this work we present an automatic algorithm to detect basic shapes
in unorganized point clouds.  The algorithm decomposes the point cloud
into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a set of
remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of
corresponding points.  Our method is based on random sampling and
detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For models with
surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD models, we
automatically obtain a representation solely consisting of shape
proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even in the
presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed
method scales well with respect to the size of the input point cloud
and the number and size of the shapes within the data.  Even point
sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within
less than a minute.  Moreover the algorithm is conceptually simple and
easy to implement. Application areas include measurement of physical
parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering,
shape classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and
reverse engineering
