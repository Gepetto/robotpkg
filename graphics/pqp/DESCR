PQP is a library for performing three types of proximity queries on a pair of
geometric models composed of triangles:

 * Collision detection - detecting whether the two models overlap, and
   optionally, all of the triangles that overlap.
 * Distance computation - computing the minimum distance between a pair of
   models, i.e., the distance between the closest pair of points.
 * Tolerance verification - determining whether two models are closer or
   farther than a tolerance distance.
