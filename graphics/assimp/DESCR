ASSIMP is a library to load and process geometric scenes from various
data formats. It is tailored at typical game scenarios by supporting a
node hierarchy, static or skinned meshes, materials, bone animations
and potential texture data. The library is *not* designed for speed,
it is primarily useful for importing assets from various sources once
and storing it in a engine-specific format for easy and fast
every-day-loading. ASSIMP is also able to apply various post
processing steps to the imported data such as conversion to indexed
meshes, calculation of normals or tangents/bitangents or conversion
from right-handed to left-handed coordinate systems.

ASSIMP currently supports the following file formats (note that some
loaders lack some features of their formats because some file formats
contain data not supported by ASSIMP, some stuff would require so much
conversion work that it has not been implemented yet and some (most
...) formats lack proper specifications):
